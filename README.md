# Next.js Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

To clone this project, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```

Replace `your-username` and `your-repo-name` with the actual repository details.

### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory

After cloning, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd nextjs1
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

### Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables:

```plaintext
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration.

### Step 5: Run the Development Server

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

### Step 6: Collaborate with Your Team

To collaborate effectively:
1. Use Git for version control. Always create a new branch for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Commit your changes with clear and concise messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: your-feature-name"
   ```
3. Push your branch to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
4. Create a pull request on GitHub and request reviews from your team.

### Additional Notes

- Follow the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) for advanced configuration and features.
- Ensure your code follows the project's coding standards and conventions.
- Regularly pull the latest changes from the `main` branch to keep your local repository up to date:
  
  ```bash
  git pull origin main
  ```
